## Description 
1. Create an application called Registrar that has the following classes:
    - [x] A [Student](Student.java) class that minimally stores the following data fields for a student:
        - name
        - student id number
        - number of credits
        - total grade points earned
        - The following methods should also be provided:
            - A constructor that initializes the name and id fields 
            - A method that returns the student name field
            - A method that returns the student ID field
            - A method that determines if two student objects are equal if their student
        - id numbers are the same (override equals from the class Object)
            - Methods to set and retrieve the total number of credits
            - Methods to set and retrieve the total number of grade points earned
            - A method that returns the GPA (grade points divided by credits)
    - [x] An [Instructor](Instructor.java) class that minimally stores the following data fields for an instructor:
        - name
        - faculty id number
        - department
        - The following methods should also be provided:
            - A constructor that initializes the name and id fields 
            - Methods to set and retrieve the instructorâ€™s department
    - [x] A [Course](Course.java) class that minimally stores the following data for a course:
        - name of the course
        - course registration code
        - maximum number of 35 students
        - instructor
        - number of students
        - students registered in the course (an array)
        - The following methods should also be provided:
            - A constructor that initializes the name, registration code, and maximum number of students
            - Methods to set and retrieve the instructor
            - A method to search for a student in the course; the search should be based on an ID number.
            - A method to add a student to the course. If the course is full, then an
    exception with an appropriate message should be raised (try creating your
    own exception class for this). Also, be sure that the student is not already
    registered in the course. The list of students should be in the order that
    they registered.
            - A method to remove a student from the course. If the student is not
    found, then an exception with an appropriate message should be raised
    (use the same exception class mentioned above).
            - A method that will allow Course objects to be output to a file using
    object serialization
            - A method that will allow Course objects to be read in from a file created
    with Object serializtion

2. Write a second main program called [Registrar](Registrar.java) that provides a menu to allow the user to: 
    - create a course, prompting the user for all of the course information,
    - add students to the course,
    - check to see if a student is registered in the course, and
    - remove a student from the course.
